<h1>Starting a new stack</h1>

<p>
  I started out as a developer by working with Javascript and I mostly worked with Angular for my frontend and Nodejs for my backend and I worked with these technologies for a while, but after some time I had to pick up Meteor js mainly because I needed it to work on a particular project. It wasn’t too difficult moving from Angular to Meteor because they are both built on JS, but here’s a few tips that got me started out fast with Meteor:

    Documentation is your friend: When starting out a new stack, it would do a lot of good to canvass the documentation as much as you can. Hoping the stack has proper documentation, this is the best place for you to have a deep understanding of what you can do and how you can do anything you want. The documentation usually provides a very rich idea of how to navigate your way through building out something with the stack. Usually documentations have a tutorial you can follow just to get the basics, this might be a good way for you to start, you can also get a good structure/layout for your project from here, although later you can decide to modify the structure as you please.

    Don’t just read, build: Many people fall into the trap of reading through lots and lots of tutorials without actually implementing what they read. By doing this you will have a passive knowledge which could easily slip. The best way to learn is by doing, implement what you read, this will not only help you have a better picture of what you’re doing but you’ll possibly run into challenges you didn’t expect while trying to implement which you’d have to look for a solution too and will in turn help you learn other things, without actually practicing, this may not happen. You don’t need to start with an ambiguous project, start with something small, something you can finish within a week, a basic CRUD application would do, for beginners, when you have mastered that, you can move on to creating something a bit more complicated
  </li>

    When you’re stuck, look for help: You’ll definitely run into blockers, blockers only mean you’re trying something new and making progress, if you don’t have blockers it means you’re only doing something you already know how to do and you know it so well that you don’t have a problem working it out, but if you have a blocker, rejoice!, it means you’re moving forward. If you run into a blocker, try to find out the root cause, you could easily find out what’s wrong by investigating it a little but if the investigation is taking more time than necessary, it would be better to look for help via the internet or someone with more experience in that area. When it’s taking too long to find the solution to a problem, especially when you’re just a beginner in that area, it might become frustrating and cause you to lose interest so it’s better to fix the issue in time so you can move on to something else, if you find the solution yourself or reach out for help, either way you get to learn something. work smart!
  </li>

    Learn what you need per time: Don’t go beyond yourself. As you need something pick it up to learn, don’t stress yourself learning what you don’t need immediately. That’s why it’s a good idea to build an app to learn because as you implement features in the app, you learn what you need. If you start picking up things you won’t necessarily need in the nearest future, while working on other things, there’s every tendency you won’t remember vividly how it’s done as at the time you need it, you’d still need to go back to relearn, although it may be easier to pick up tis time. Learn as you go.
